# Grepping Errors


This challenge will overwhelm the stderr with output we have to grep through it without directing the output to a file and get the flag that way
## Solution:

just run the command given below and it will return the flag

```sh
$ /challenge/run 2>&1 | grep pwn.college 
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{gEFwPGawwruZIok4zEm_Zl-Gm0w.QX1ATO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
