# Process Substitution for Input

The challenge asks us to redirect "COLLEGE" to a file `PWN` and then redirect that contents in that `PWN` file to `/challenge/run`

## Solution:

we can just echo "COLLEGE" to `~/PWN` file  and  then redirect that file as input to `/challenge/run`

```sh
$ echo "COLLEGE" > PWN && /challenge/run < PWN
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{wb-1LK7WfTS0sympAI1LxkVATX4.QXwcTN0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
