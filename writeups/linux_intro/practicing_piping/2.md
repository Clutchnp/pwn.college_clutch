# Redirecting more output

This challenge basically wants us to redirect the output of `/challenge/run` to a file. 

## Solution:

We just have to run `/challenge/run` and redirect it's output to myflag file

```sh
$ /challenge/run > myflag
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{o-CRHF4FeAnhE2hMX07UXFmxXwI.QX1YTN0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
