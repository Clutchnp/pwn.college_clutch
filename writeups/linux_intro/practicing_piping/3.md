# Appending Output

This challenge wants gives us the flag in two operations, we have to capture the flag which the file writes.

## Solution:

to avoid overwriting we can do pipe in append mode using `>>` so that instead of being overwritten the output of the second command is appended to the first 

```sh
$ /challenge/run >> the-flag
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{UMn1NTUjCjMVDu74toRAD71lzOw.QX3ATO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
