# Filtering with grep -v 

This challenge instead of using grep to include the matching part, it wants us to ignore the lines containing the target 

## Solution:

just redirect the output of `/challenge/run` to stdout and then filter out decoy using `grep -v`

```sh
$ /challenge/run >&1 | grep -v DECOY
```

## Flag:
