# Grepping Stored Results 

This challenge wants us to redirect the output of `/challenge/run` to `/tmp/data.txt` and then grep that file to get the flag

## Solution:

just run the command below

```sh
$ /challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt && grep pwn.college /tmp/data.txt
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{4N6NO2vLaE8L8SgZEYt7KuBMWVW.QX4EDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
