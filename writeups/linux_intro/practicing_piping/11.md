# Process substitution 

So what challenge asks us is we have to run diff on inputs of 2 commands to get a flag 



## Solution:

To do that we can just use process substituion using the commands on below on `/challenge/print_decoys` and `/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag`

```sh
$ diff <(/challenge/print_decoys) <(/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag)
```

## Flag:
