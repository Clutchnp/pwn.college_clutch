# Suspending Prcoesses

This challenge wants us to suspend an instance of /challenge/run so that the other /challenge/run can detect it and give us the flag

## Solution:

just press CTRL-Z after running the /challenge/run

```sh
$ /challenge/run 
$ To pass this level, you need to suspend me and launch me again! You can 
background me with Ctrl-Z or, if you're not ready to do that for whatever 
reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
$ /challenge/run 
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{Qm-z1SKCaOvu3yW8RRcH_Jrremd.QX1QDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
