# Resuming Processes

this challenge wants us to suspend and resume a process to get the flag

## Solution:

we can suspend using ctrl-z in the previous round or `kill -19` or and then resume using `kill -18`  or `fg`

```sh
$ /challenge/run 
$ ^Z
$ fg
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{UkjkmV7wCrH2Poai3j4MqK7eaj9.QX2QDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
