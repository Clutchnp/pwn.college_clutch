# Killing Processes

This challenge wants us to kill a process before running it 

## Solution:

there are several methods for this specific problem, we get process id and then use kill or we can just directly use pkill but since the challenge does give a background of PID's i will use kill

```sh
$ ps -e | grep sleep
$ kill sleep
$ /challenge/run
```
