# Interuptting processes

This challenge will not give us a flag until we interupt a process

## Solution:

we can just do this by doing ctrl c 

```sh
$ /challenge/run 
"I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
"
```

## Flag:
