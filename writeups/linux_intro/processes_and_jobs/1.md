# Listing Process

The challenge tells us that it has listed a process which coressponds with the file containing the flag, we have to somehow get this flag

## Solution:

This can be done by using ps aux or top to get the name of the process, and then runing it which shall give us the flag

```sh
$ ps aux | grep /challenge
$ /challenge/26993-run-4042
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{AO8IldUiUv1zJq_XS2vNNrys58f.QX4MDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
