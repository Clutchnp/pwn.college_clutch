# Tab Completion

Basically this challenge wants us to cat the `challenge/pwncollege` file without actually typing the filename but rather tab completing it 

## Solution:

just  cat `/challenge/pwncollege` but don't type the whole pwncollege name but rather just type pwn of the pwncollege and press <TAB> key 

```sh
$  cat /challenge/pwncollege<TAB>
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{su4Rj1wpoRmLxErPo5CxYPWnN7u.0FN0EzNxwSMwAzNzEzW}
```
