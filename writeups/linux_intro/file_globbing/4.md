# Matching Paths with []

Same as the previous challenge but this one wants us to expand the files names with the whole path instead of just files 

## Solution:

just run the `/challenge/run` with absolute paths as argument as done below

```sh
$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{UUNJ8rUX-0lC8_8u7rn0lOeYkzu.QX0IDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
