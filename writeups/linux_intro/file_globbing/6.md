# Mixing Globs

so we have to write pass an argument to `/challenge/run` which expands into challenging, pwning and educational

## Solution:

since their first characters are unique we can match them with square brackets and rest of the letters can be anything so use *

```sh
$ cd /challenge/files
$ ../challenge/run [cpe]*
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{0ylMvtIkAfb4WdImrWBXMFmeH9s.QX1IDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
