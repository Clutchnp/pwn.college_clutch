# exclusionary globbing

This program wants us to provide an argument to `/challenge/run` which expnads to all the files in the `/challenge/files` directory which don't start with 'p' 'w' or 'n'

## Solution:

cd into the /challenge/files directory and do the globbing with `[^pwn]`

```sh
$ cd /challenge/files
$ ../run [^pwn]
```


```
pwn.college{oLkhsT8U2MhieVvxzEId9wpvhfy.QX2IDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
