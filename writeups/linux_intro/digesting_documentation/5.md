# Searching for manuals

This challenge was fun, the question asks us to find a hidden manpage and using the manpage give the appropriate flag for /challenge/challenge binary

## Solution:

just man man and grep manpages , where you will find the wildcard option and just use that option for searching for flag 


```sh
$  man man | grep manpages
$  man --wildcard flag
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{wh-iEr3HeUcdZnKoPmZuWv_9OCe.QX2EDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
