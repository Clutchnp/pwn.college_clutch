# An Epic Filesystem Quest
This was a problem where we have to explore the filesystem according to the question until we find the file containing the flag

## Solution:

checked the "/" directory first and then went as the clues led me to README file
There were many files so I am just writing the basic commands I used
```sh
$ ls -a 
$ cat 
$ cd
$ ls 
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{45ajU2UTknohJpkhji1el4cotWI.QXzMDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
