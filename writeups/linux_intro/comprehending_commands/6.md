# listing files

So the question wants us to run the run file under /challenge as usual but this time run is named something different

## Solution:

Just list all the files in the /challenge directory from where you can run the name u recieved which in my case was 6881-renamed-run-18174  which gave me the flag


```sh
$ ls /challenge
$ /challenge/6881-renamed-run-18174
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{QurRJ-d7avRR4Ym8jhyobpnMQlI.QX4IDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
