# moving files

basically the challenge wants us to move a file from one location to another

## Solution:

just move the /flag to /tmp/hack-the-planet in the process which also renames the file
```sh
$  mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet
$ /challenge/check
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{MAMvfsEnaJ5sUOokfA6hpZynRGw.0VOxEzNxwSMwAzNzEzW}
```
