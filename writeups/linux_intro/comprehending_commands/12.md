# making directories

The problem just asks us to create a directory and a file within it 

## Solution:

I just created a folder in the tmp folder and creating a file in it using the touch command using the commands listed below


```sh
$ mkdir /tmp/pwn
$ touch /tmp/pwn/college
$ /challenge/run
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{8-DMhkDR4y-hbD-LT1foD7cSf8X.QXxMDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
