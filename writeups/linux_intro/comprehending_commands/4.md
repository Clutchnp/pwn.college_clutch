# Grepping for a needle in a haystack

the question gives us a file and asks us to find the flag from there, we are not told on which line or where the flag is in the file 

## Solution:

Since the flag always starts with pwn.college we can just grep it and grep will provide us with the flag

```sh
$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{UjYHR0MaNcFZmDLkArBvBK0U1Fz.QX3EDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
