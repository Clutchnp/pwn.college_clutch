# touching files

this question basically asked to create two files and run the `/challenge/run` to get the program

## Solution:

We should create two files /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college as said in the question and run the /challenge/run binary which will give us the flag

```sh
$ touch /tmp/pwn
$ touch /tmp/college
$ /challenge/run
```

## Flag: 

```
pwn.college{MOJ0WOWbCfn0p955XZrfbSD3xRo.QXwMDO0wSMwAzNzEzW}
```
